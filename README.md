This Java program, known as the File Handling Utility, is designed to perform basic file operations such as reading, writing, and modifying text files through a user-friendly command-line interface. The program leverages essential Java classes like `BufferedWriter`, `BufferedReader`, and `RandomAccessFile` to accomplish these tasks. Upon running the program, users are presented with a menu offering four options: write to a file, read from a file, modify a file, and exit the program. The `writeFile` method allows users to input text, which is then written to a specified file using `BufferedWriter`. The `readFile` method reads the file's contents line by line using `BufferedReader` and displays them on the console. The `modifyFile` method employs `RandomAccessFile` to clear the existing content of the file and write new user-input text, effectively replacing the old content. The main method features a looped menu to ensure continuous interaction until the user chooses to exit.

Here's a brief overview of the key components:
- **Main Menu**: Displays options for file operations.
- **writeFile Method**: Prompts the user to enter text and writes it to the file.
- **readFile Method**: Reads and displays the file's contents.
- **modifyFile Method**: Replaces the file's contents with new text.
- **Exit**: Ends the program.

This program serves as a simple yet effective framework for basic file handling operations in Java, providing clear documentation through comments to guide users through each step. It can be easily expanded or customized to fit specific requirements or incorporate more advanced features, making it a valuable tool for managing text files.
